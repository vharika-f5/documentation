## Overview

This guide explains how to deploy F5 NGINXaaS for Google Cloud (NGINXaaS) using [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and the NGINXaaS Console. The deployment process involves creating a new deployment, configuring the deployment, and testing the deployment.

## Before you begin

Before you can deploy NGINXaaS, follow the steps in the [Prerequisites]({{< ref "/nginxaas-google/getting-started/prerequisites/" >}}) topic to subscribe to the NGINXaaS for Google Cloud offering in the Google Cloud Marketplace.

### Create a network attachment

NGINXaaS requires a [network attachment](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/about-network-attachments) to connect your NGINXaaS deployment to your VPC network. The network attachment must be created in a region we support.

{{< call-out "caution" >}}
{{< include "/nginxaas-google/supported-regions.md" >}}
{{< /call-out >}}

1. Access the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
1. Create a consumer VPC network and subnetwork. See [Google's documentation on creating a VPC and subnet](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/create-modify-vpc-networks#console_1) for a step-by-step guide.
   - The region you select for the network attachment determines the region where your NGINXaaS deployment will be created. You do not manually select a region when creating an NGINXaaS deployment; it will automatically be created in the same region as the network attachment.
1. Create a network attachment in your new subnet. See [Google's documentation on creating a network attachment](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/create-manage-network-attachments#create-network-attachments) for a step-by-step guide. To ensure secure and controlled access to your network attachments, we strongly recommend configuring the **Connection preference** on the Network Attachment resource to **Accept connections from selected projects**. This option helps maintain security by ensuring only trusted providers can connect to your service by letting you manually approve trusted connections. To start, you can leave the list of accepted projects empty and add the NGINXaaS deployment project after it is created.

   {{< call-out "caution" >}}
   For development and testing purposes, or in scenarios where speed and simplicity are prioritized over security, you have the option to configure the **Connection Preference** to **Automatically accept connections for all projects**. Please note that this approach is inherently less secure and may expose your service to unintended or unauthorized access. We encourage you to exercise caution if using the less restrictive option and to avoid using it in production or sensitive environments.
   {{< /call-out >}}

1. Make a note of the network attachment ID as it will be needed in the next steps to create your NGINXaaS deployment. You can find the network attachment ID in the Google Cloud Console by following the steps below:
   1. Go to Network Attachments at the following link: https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/psc/list/networkAttachments?project=my-google-project (replace `my-google-project` in the URL with your project name).
   1. Open the desired network attachment and copy the value from the `Network Attachment` field. **Example format:** `projects/my-google-project/regions/us-east1/networkAttachments/my-network-attachment`.

## Access the NGINXaaS Console

Once you have completed the subscription process and created a network attachment, you can access the NGINXaaS Console.

- Visit [https://console.nginxaas.net/](https://console.nginxaas.net/) to access the NGINXaaS Console.
- Log in to the console with your Google credentials.
- Select the appropriate Geography to work in, based on the region your network attachment was created in.

## Create or import an NGINX configuration

{{< include "/nginxaas-google/create-or-import-nginx-config.md" >}}

## Create a new deployment

Next, create a new NGINXaaS deployment using the NGINXaaS Console:

1. On the left menu, select **Deployments**.
1. Select {{< icon "plus" >}} **Add Deployment** to create a new deployment.

   - Enter a **Name**.
   - Add an optional description for your deployment.
   - Change the **NCU Capacity** if needed.
      - The default value of `20 NCU` should be adequate for most scenarios.
   - Enable **WAF** if you want [F5 WAF for NGINX]({{< ref "/waf" >}}) enabled for your deployment.
   - In the Apply Configuration section, select an NGINX configuration [you created earlier](#create-or-import-an-nginx-configuration) from the **Choose Configuration** list.
   - Select a **Configuration Version** from the list.
   - In the Cloud Details section, enter the network attachment ID that [you created earlier](#create-a-network-attachment) or select it in the  **Network attachment** list.
      - The network attachment ID is formatted like the following example: `projects/my-google-project/regions/us-east1/networkAttachments/my-network-attachment`.
   - Select **Managed Public Endpoint** or **Private Endpoint** under Service Frontend. 
      - Refer to the [Service Frontend]({{< ref "/nginxaas-google/overview.md#service-frontend" >}}) documentation for more information on these two frontend types.
   - Select **Submit** to begin the deployment process.

Your new deployment will appear in the list of deployments. The status of the deployment will be "Pending" while the deployment is being created. Once the deployment is complete, the status will change to "Ready".

{{< call-out "important" >}}If the **Connection preference** on the Network Attachment resource is set to **Accept connections from selected projects**, you will need to add the **NGINXaaS deployment project** to the list of **Accepted projects** for the deployment to provision successfully. The NGINXaaS deployment `Project ID` can be found under the `Cloud Info` section for your deployment. Failing to do so will leave the deployment in a `Pending` state, with details provided on the necessary actions required to proceed.{{< /call-out >}}

## Configure your deployment

In the NGINXaaS Console,

1. To open the details of your deployment, select its name from the list of deployments.
   - You can view the details of your deployment, including the status, region, network attachment, NGINX configuration, and more.
1. Select **Edit** to modify the deployment description, NCU Capacity, and WAF enablement.
   - You can also configure monitoring from here. Detailed instructions can be found in [Enable Monitoring]({{< ref "/nginxaas-google/monitoring/enable-monitoring.md" >}})
1. Select **Update** to save your changes.
1. Select the Configuration tab to view the current NGINX configuration associated with the deployment.
1. Select **Update Configuration** to change the NGINX configuration associated with the deployment.
1. To modify the contents of the NGINX configuration, see [Update an NGINX Configuration]({{< ref "/nginxaas-google/getting-started/nginx-configuration/nginx-configuration-console.md#update-an-nginx-configuration" >}}).

## Set up connectivity (Private Endpoint only)

If you selected **Private Endpoint** as the service frontend type, complete the following steps to allow client access. If you selected **Managed Public Endpoint**, skip this section.**

### Internal traffic

To set up private connectivity to your NGINXaaS deployment, create a [Private Service Connect (PSC) endpoint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-services) in the same VPC as your internal clients.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select the project where you want to create networking resources for your F5 NGINXaaS deployment.
1. Create or reuse a [VPC network](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/create-modify-vpc-networks).
1. Create a PSC endpoint. See [Google's documentation on creating an endpoint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-services#create-endpoint) for a step-by-step guide.
    - For **Target service**, enter your NGINXaaS deployment's Service Attachment, which is visible on the `Deployment Details` section for your deployment.


### External traffic

To set up public connectivity for external clients, configure a [Private Service Connect (PSC) backend](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect-backends) for your NGINXaaS deployment.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select the project where you want to create networking resources for your F5 NGINXaaS deployment.
1. Create or reuse a [VPC network](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/create-modify-vpc-networks).
1. Create a proxy-only subnet in your consumer VPC. See [Google's documentation on creating a proxy-only subnet](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/tcp/set-up-ext-reg-tcp-proxy-zonal#console_1) for a step-by-step guide.
1. Create a public IP address. See [Google's documentation on reserving a static address](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/tcp/set-up-ext-reg-tcp-proxy-zonal#console_3) for a step-by-step guide.
1. Create a Private Service Connect Network Endpoint Group (PSC NEG). See [Google's documentation on creating a NEG](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/access-apis-managed-services-private-service-connect-backends#console) for a step-by-step guide.
   - Set **Network endpoint group type** to **Private Service Connect NEG (Regional)**.
   - Set **Target** to **Published service**.
   - For **Target service**, enter your NGINXaaS deployment's Service Attachment, which is visible on the `Deployment Details` section for your deployment.
   - For **Producer port**, enter the port your NGINX server is listening on. If you're using the default NGINX config, enter port `80`.
   - For **Network** and **Subnetwork** select your consumer VPC network and subnet.
1. Create a regional external proxy Network Load Balancer. See [Google's documentation on configuring the load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/tcp/set-up-ext-reg-tcp-proxy-zonal#console_6) for a step-by-step guide.
   - For **Network**, select your consumer VPC network.
   - For **Backend configuration**, follow [Google's step-by-step guide to add a backend](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/access-apis-managed-services-private-service-connect-backends#console_5).
   - In the **Frontend configuration** section,
      - For **IP address**, select the public IP address created earlier.
      - For **Port number**, enter the same port as your NEG's Producer port, for example, port `80`.


Each listening port configured on NGINX requires its own PSC network endpoint group with a matching port. You can use the following helper script to automate these steps:

{{< details summary="Show helper script" >}}

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   set -euo pipefail
   # Default values
   PROJECT=""
   REGION=""
   NETWORK=""
   SUBNET=""
   SA_URI=""
   PORTS="80"
   PROXY_SUBNET="psc-proxy-subnet"
   VIPNAME="psc-vip"

   # Prerequisites:
   # - gcloud CLI installed and configured
   # - An existing projectID and a VPC network created in that project
   # - A valid Service Attachment URI from F5 NGINXaaS

   # Function to display usage
   usage() {
      cat << EOF
   Usage: $0 --project PROJECT --region REGION --network NETWORK --subnet SUBNET --service-attachment SA_URI [--ports PORTS]

   Options:
      --project                 GCP Project ID
      --region                  GCP Region
      --network                 VPC Network name
      --subnet                  GCP Subnet for Backend Connectivity (must be in the same region and network)
      --service-attachment      Service Attachment Self Link
      --ports                   Comma-separated list of ports (default: 80)
      --help                    Show this help message

   Note: Proxy subnet and public IP will be automatically created as 'psc-proxy-subnet' and 'psc-vip' respectively.
      These resources will not be deleted, if deleted this script will create new ones.

## Test your deployment

1. To test your deployment, connect to the IP address created in [Set up connectivity]({{< ref "/nginxaas-google/getting-started/create-deployment/deploy-console.md#set-up-connectivity-private-endpoint-only" >}}) or the service endpoint created with your managed public endpoint deployment.

{{< call-out "note" >}}

The deployment is privately deployed in your subnet. If you want to route traffic to an application over the public internet, consider setting up [Cloud NAT](https://docs.cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview).
