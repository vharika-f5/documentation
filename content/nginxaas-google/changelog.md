- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS for Google now supports F5 WAF for NGINX (Preview)**

## April 16, 2026

- {{% icon-feature %}} **NGINXaaS for Google now supports Managed Public Endpoint deployments (Preview)**

You can now deploy NGINXaaS with an internet-facing managed public endpoint.

**Note:** This feature is currently in preview; pricing may change.

See the [Service Frontend]({{< ref "/nginxaas-google/overview.md#service-frontend" >}}) documentation for more information about managed public endpoint.
